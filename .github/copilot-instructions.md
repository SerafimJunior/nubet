# Copilot Instructions for nubet

This project appears to be in its initial stages, with only a README.md present and no code or configuration files yet. The following instructions are designed to help AI coding agents be immediately productive as the codebase evolves:

## Project Overview
- **Project Name:** nubet
- **Domain:** Betting platform ("Casa de apostas")
- **Current State:** No code or architecture present yet. This is a greenfield project.

## Getting Started
- **Initial Setup:** If starting development, establish a clear folder structure (e.g., `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`).
- **Documentation:** Update README.md with architecture, workflows, and conventions as they are defined.

## AI Agent Guidance
- **Architecture:** Document major components and data flows as soon as they are created. Reference key files and directories for each subsystem.
- **Workflows:** Add build, test, and debug instructions to README.md or a dedicated `docs/` folder as they are established.
- **Conventions:** Note any project-specific patterns or naming conventions in this file and in README.md.
- **External Integrations:** List dependencies and integration points in README.md and update as the project grows.

## Example Patterns (to be updated)
- As code is added, provide examples of:
  - Service boundaries and communication
  - Data models and flow
  - Testing strategies
  - Build and deployment commands

## How to Update This File
- Merge new conventions and workflows here as the project evolves.
- Reference key files and directories that exemplify important patterns.
- Keep instructions concise and actionable for future AI agents.
